## Problem: Discovering Why Customers are Churning?

**1.	Data Preparation:**
The first step is to ensure that the data is prepared, before doing any analysis. Verifying the data with simple check i.e. putting data in a table formats and then investigating whether are any duplicate rows in our customer level data or doing any other cleaning such as handling missing data, or conditional formatting.

**2.	Calculating Churn**
It is useful to have a measure that calculates churn before deep-diving into the analysis.
There is a column called Churn Label that indicates “Yes” or “No”

So, this column is converted to a binomial column indicating if the customer churned or not. It will be used to calculate the churn rate.

“Yes” then 1
“No” then 0
